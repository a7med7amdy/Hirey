        answer2: "Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties' direct access to them.",

        question: "Explain the term constructor",
        answer1: "A constructor is a method used to initialize the state of an object, and it gets invoked automatically at the time of object creation. Rules for constructor are:Constructor Name should be the same as a class name.A constructor must have no return type.",
        answer2: "Constructors have the same name as the class or struct, and they usually initialize the data members of the new object.",
        answer3: "A class constructor is a special member function of a class that is executed whenever we create new objects of that class. A constructor will have exact same name as the class and it does not have any return type at all,"

        id: 14,
        question: "Define Destructor?",
        answer1: "A destructor is a method which is automatically called when the object is made of scope or destroyed. Destructor name is also same as class name but with the tilde symbol before the name.",
        answer2: "A destructor is a member function that is invoked automatically when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly destroyed by a call to delete . A destructor has the same name as the class, preceded by a tilde",
        answer3: "A destructor is a special method that gets called automatically as soon as the life-cycle of an object is finished. A destructor is called to de-allocate and free memory."

        question: "What is an Inline function?",
        answer1: " enhancement feature to increase the execution time of a program. Functions can be instructed to compiler to make them inline so that compiler can replace those function definition wherever those are being called.",
        answer2: "Inline function is a function that is expanded in line when it is called. When the inline function is called whole code of the inline function gets inserted or substituted at the point of inline function call.",
        answer3: "An inline function is a function that is expanded inline when it is invoked, thus saving time. The compiler replaces the function call with the corresponding function code,"

        question: "What is a virtual function?",
        answer1: "A virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is re-defined(Overriden) by a derived class.",
        answer2: "A virtual function is a member function of a class, and its functionality can be overridden in its derived class. This function can be implemented by using a keyword called virtual, and it can be given during function declaration.",
        answer3: "A virtual function is a member function that you expect to be redefined in derived classes."
    },
    {
        id: 17,
        question: "why we need a virtual destructor in Inheritance?",
        answer1: "the virtual destructor ensures that when derived subclasses go out of scope or are deleted the order of destruction of each class in a hierarchy is carried out correctly. If the destruction order of the class objects is incorrect, in can lead to what is known as a memory leak.",
        answer2: "Deleting a derived class object using a pointer of base class type that has a non-virtual destructor results in undefined behavior. To correct this situation, the base class should be defined with a virtual destructor.",
        answer3: "A virtual destructor is used to free up the memory space allocated by the derived class object or instance while deleting instances of the derived class using a base class pointer object. A base or parent class destructor use the virtual keyword that ensures both base class and the derived class destructor will be called at run time, but it called the derived class first and then base class to release the space occupied by both destructors."

        id: 18,
        question: "What is a friend function?",
        answer1: "A friend function is a friend of a class that is allowed to access to Public, private, or protected data in that same class. If the function is defined outside the class cannot access such information.A friend can be declared anywhere in the class declaration, and it cannot be affected by access control keywords like private, public, or protected.",
        answer2: "A friend function of a class is defined outside that class' scope but it has the right to access all private and protected members of the class.",
        answer3: "that is a friend of a given class, is a function that is given the same access as methods to private and protected data."

        id: 19,
        question: "What is function overloading?",
        answer1: "Function overloading is a regular function, but it can perform different tasks. It allows the creation of several methods with the same name which differ from each other by the type of input and output of the function.",
        answer2: "Function overloading is a feature in C++ where two or more functions can have the same name but different parameters.",
        answer3: "programming feature that allows us to have more than one function having same name but different parameter list,"
